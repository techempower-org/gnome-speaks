# `dead-recorder` — baseline

The pinned SHA(s) this suite discriminates against and what fails there.
`tests/repros/gen_readme.sh` collects the table rows below (every line that
starts with `| ` except the header and separator) into the generated block in
`tests/repros/README.md` — edit THIS file, then run the generator. Pin SHAs,
never branch names (see README, "Baselines are pinned SHAs").

| suite | issue / PR | baseline | expected there |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dead-recorder` | #57, #48 / #72 | `e863b2c` | **verified** — e, f, h fail; g, i pass |
